# [Gym App]

## Introduction

This app is intended o provide weightlifters with a more efficient and convenient way to track their progress and achieve their goals of increasing size and strength through progressive overload. It offers a user-friendly mobile app designed to simplify the process of monitoring and recording workout data. Instead of relying on traditional paper notebooks, users can seamlessly input and track their weightlifting routines, allowing them to easily adjust and analyze their performance over time. This app streamlines the workout tracking process, eliminating the need to carry a physical notebook and pen, and addresses common issues associated with traditional methods, such as the risk of losing or forgetting the notebook.
